This is a package that sets up the ORM using SQLAlchemy and the api using FastAPI.
    - __init__.py tells Python that this directory is a package and its files are modules
    - database.py sets up the database connection
    - models.py sets up the ORM object classes that we will be using
    - schemas.py mirrors the object classes with table schemas for the ORM
    - database_secrets.py contains the database endpoint, username, password, etc...
    - crud.py contains the functions we will use to interact with the database
        CRUD -> create, read, update, delete

    # Only the files above are needed to use the ORM and the database

    - main.py deals with the API endpoints and interacts with the ORM
